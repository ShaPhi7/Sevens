# Sevens
Play a game of sevens - the [card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_(card_game)) that is, not the [Rugby game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens).

This was a small implementation that I wrote a while ago. I dusted it off to discover that the code seems fairly readable, although there are a few things I'd do differently. I may yet update it!

Note: CLI only (no GUI).

## Building the project

Simply built using `mvn clean install`, obviously having Apache Maven installed is a prerequisite.

## Running the project 

Simply run using `java -jar <name of jar>`. Java 8+ recommended.
